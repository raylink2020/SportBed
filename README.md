INTRODUCTION
------------

Research has shown that putting hospital patients in a prone position provides better oxygen flow. In order to flip patients into this position, multiple nurses have to use a lot of time and effort to complete the process. Other people have proposed solutions to this; however, none have safely been able to accomplish everything that must be done. One existing bed is capable of rolling a patient but does not allow for typical ICU operations to commence. Another option that exists is unrealistically expensive and would not be a feasible purchase for most hospitals. On the contrary, our proposed solution negates the need for the presence of multiple nurses by having a mechanism doing all the “heavy-lifting” for the nurses. Our design uses the sheet the patient is on as a conveyor belt of sorts, and is able to turn a patient safely and with cost efficiency. This solution also allows for typical ICU operations to continue running—unlike the current competition.
